Generative AI Image Editor

This project is a text-to-image generation prototype that allows users to create images from descriptive text prompts, apply artistic styles, and modify images with mask-based editing—all from a user-friendly interface. Built using Stable Diffusion and Gradio, it showcases generative AI techniques in an accessible format.

Project Overview

The project is designed as a creative generative AI tool, demonstrating techniques in image generation, style selection, and interactive UI design. It’s ideal for those interested in exploring generative AI and creative applications.

Key Features

	•	Text-to-Image Generation: Enter a text prompt, and the model generates an image based on your description.
	•	Style Selection: Choose from different artistic styles such as “Realistic,” “Sketch,” “Watercolor,” and “Vintage.”
	•	Prompt Suggestions: Click on example prompts to see instant results.
	•	Mask-Based Editing (Simulated): Select a region of the image to apply visual effects based on the prompt.
	•	Simple, Intuitive UI: Built with Gradio for easy access to all features.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.7 or higher

Running the Project
